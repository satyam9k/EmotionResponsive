# Emotion Recognition and Music Recommendation System

## Overview

This project is an Emotion Recognition and Music Recommendation System that uses facial emotion recognition, voice emotion detection, and a song recommendation mechanism based on the detected emotions. The system leverages several machine learning models for emotion detection and text transcription, and integrates audio and video processing functionalities.

## Features

- **Facial Emotion Recognition**: Captures video and detects facial emotions using a pre-trained model.
- **Voice Emotion Recognition**: Records audio, transcribes it to text, and predicts emotions from the transcribed text.
- **Complex Emotion Recognition**: Combines facial and voice emotion detections to provide a final emotion result.
- **Music Recommendation**: Recommends and plays a song based on the detected emotion.
